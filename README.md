## Description

I wrote a program that converts a temperature from fahrenheit to celsius, and from celsius to fahrenheit. If the temperature is greater than 90F/32C the color of the converted temperature should be red. If the temperature is less than 32F/0C the color of the converted temperature should be blue. For any other temperature, the color should be green. The application will convert the temperature after you select a radio button. Your choices are C and F. One you select your radio button and type in the temperature in the input box, the temperature will convert on a key up press.
